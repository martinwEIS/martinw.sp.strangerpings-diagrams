===\t\t\tThe Laundry List
"<u:red>We have an overdeveloped sense of responsibility</u>"

# It is <back:WhiteSmoke><u>easier</u></back> (//"necessary"//) for us to be
concerned with others rather than ourselves

# This enables us not to look too closely
at our own faults, etc.;

***:===As Children
====Magical Powers
* natural belief we are omnipotent
* child cries and caregiver appears
|Belief :  crying == produces caregiver (magically)|

* **Magical powers** are overused to give normalcy in chaotic family
** family acts crazily
*** magical powers (crying) could control them
*** became responsible to control them even though
         it was not our responsibility and was beyond our control.
*** Try to treat the symptom(the action/behavior)
          not problem(alcoholism)
* **Rescuer Role** (emerges)
|_ As Victim or
|_ As Victimzer
|= Internal Dosing |= Effect    |
| Adrenaline      | Excitement |
| Cortisol        | Worry      |
|                 | Internal Speeedball|
;<<asChild>>

****:==As Adults
The Tactic (rescuer role) became a "Habit" to:
* __ALWAYS__ "assume" over-responsibility for others (insert myself)
** __WHY__ : because it gave us an excuse not look at ourselves

**"Habit" (over) "Honesty"**
| Looking at self => discomfort & pain(depression/sadness) =>\n Being "responsible" and "helpful" to others (aka rescuer role) =>\n Replaces "discomfort" with internal dosing of "worry" & "excitement" =>\n "Responsible" and "Helful" to others distracts from =>\n "Healing" my True Self |
;<<asAdult>>

*****: ???
**Why not look at ourselves?**
* discomfort of "honestly" looking at our pain and losses
* unexpressed feeling and memories from tramatic childhood has
   festered to the point its to BIG for "ME" to control
* when examined, almost always looking destructively and in
   a self-critical manner.
* dont know how to look at ourselves in a constructive way
;<<question>>

***:===As Children
====Necessary ==> Hypervigilance
* __Hypervigilance__ made it __necessary__ for us as
 children to focus on others so that we could __survive__

* **__"Hypervigilantly" survey__**:
|_ our thoughts and actions to feel safe **
|_ our parent’s tone of voice, body language and gestures
|_ others comments, emotions, actions and reactions
|_ our surroundings and environment for threats
;<<asChild>>

****: ???
**WHY do ACA's dread emotional pain??**
Adult children dread emotional pain because we rarely
had anyone to stand with us as we experienced anguish
as children. Growing up in a dysfunctional home,
we often endured unspeakable suffering in silence.
We became hypervigilant to emotional pain and sought
addiction, work, sex, or drugs to stay “pain” free.
